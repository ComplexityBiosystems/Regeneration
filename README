Expected input files for each considered organism:
  * the list of assembled transcripts/sequences in fasta format
  * a table with expression levels of the transcrips as a function of time in the form
        Name T0 T1 T2 T3 T4
        Seq_0008 0 0 1 1 0
        Seq_0026 31 491 135 67 81
        Seq_0037 17 37 20 38 37

Moreover, a reference database (e.g. Swissprot) is required to blastx alignment.

Transcripts are clustered using CD-Hit with a similarity thresholds between the sequences of 80%.
The expression file has to be preprocessed in order to select  a minimum level of expression
    (e.g. 20 reads or 1 rpkm)
       awk '{if(NR>1){for(i=1; i<=NF; i++){if(int($i)>minval){ print $0 >> "Expression_more20.txt"}}}}' minval=20 <input expression file>
It is possible to use either single transcripts or total gene level (sum or wighted average over transcripts) to evaluate differentially expression.
